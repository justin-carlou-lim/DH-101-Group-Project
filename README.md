## Digital + Humanities ##

![https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/08/02/rising-stars-digital-humanities](https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/Digital%20Humanities_1.jpg)


Yvonne Gonzales, Linsey Dinh, Rohan Parekh, and Jus Lim aimed to explore how the digital world and humanities world intersect. They argue the Digital Humanities work to close the divide in the academy between what is “digital” and what is “human”, creating a new discipline that bridges and combines the two fields and methods. In order to prove this, they draw from the following works: "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White?" by Tara McPherson (2012), "Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities" by Kim Gallon (2016), and "We Are All Social Scientists Now" by Justin Grimmer (2015). From these works, the project investigators concluded that the digital and humanities is a new field which draws on the history of both fields; thus, racially discriminatory ideologies from both fields must be critically reflected on and corrected in order to not perpetuate them into this new field.

For this project, I, Jus Lim contributed primarily to the conclusions and interpretations, as well as the response to Dr. Da's "Digital Humanities Debacle" (2019). In doing so, I wrote the summaries for the three articles, found their broader implications for the growinng field, and found how the articles are linked to the previously stated debacle.
